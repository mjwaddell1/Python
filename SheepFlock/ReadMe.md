This script simulates a sheep flock<br/>
Dogs gather the sheep and push them to the shepherd<br/><br/>
Notes:
- Each dog has an equal slice of the circle
- Dog slices overlap to prevent sheep from jumping between dogs
- Dog speed must be higher than sheep so dog can outrun sheep
- Sheep can overlap positions but attempt to spread out
